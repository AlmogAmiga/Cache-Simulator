# Cache-Simulator
A program to simulate a simple cache

Installation:
Download all the files that are located in the directory Cache Simulator.
If you don't run the project through Visual Studio you won't need the .sln file just the headers and source files.

Run:
After you've built the project successfully you need to specify: index, block offset, size of cache and most importantly the txt file from which you want to read the addresses.
- Addresses.txt is already attached with the project.
The addresses are 32-bit long (Or 8 hex digits). The addresses in txt file must be in hex, 8-digit only (Like in MIPS).
